## How Does It Work?
WINRUN allows you to run Windows programs on Linux. Windows runs as a VM inside a qemu/kvm and manage by libvirt, WINRUN communicate with it by using the "REDFLAG" our windows service to retrieve data from Windows. For compositing applications as native OS-level windows, we use FreeRDP together with Windows's RemoteApp protocol.
